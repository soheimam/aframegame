## Game rules

Aim to hit the bouncing blue planet with your duck shooter to stop it from colliding with the ground. This game works both with Web VR and mouse movement.

## ABOUT PROJECT

Over the summer I was recipient of a scholarship to attend JS Camp Barcelona. During my time at JS Camp I attended a A-Frame workshop, as part of the workshop we created a simple shooting game called "Quack whack".

## Learning goals
Web VR
A-Frame
Simple JS game mechanics

## A-frame learnings

A-Frame allows us to build 3D objects in our HTML document.  Unlike other 3D libraries, A-Frame objects come with standard lighting and solid material already built in objects. This allows for quick prototyping and making it easily accessible for others to learn.
